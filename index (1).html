    <h1>Atlas' Static Webpage</h1>
    <p>Hello! My name is Atlas and I am a fourth-year student at NYU <br>
    studying psychology, with a concentration in Cognitive Neuroscience. <br>
    I also have a minor in Web Applications and Programming, and I really enjoy <br>
    front-end development! <br>
    <br>
    Recently I've been learning how to use the p5.js library to code video games on the web <br>
    and I hope that I can use some of those skills in this database design class to add some <br>
    exciting elements to our final project!<p>
